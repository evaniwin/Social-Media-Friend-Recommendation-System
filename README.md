# Social Media Friend Recommendation System

```
Design and implement a console-based Social
Media Friend Recommendation System using graphs and arrays. Use a graph to model users as nodes
and friendships as edges between them. Use arrays to store users' profile information such as name,
interests, and recent activity. The system should allow users to find mutual friends, view their friend
network, and get friend recommendations based on common interests or friends of friends. Implement
graph traversal algorithms (such as BFS or DFS) to find the shortest path to potential new friends.
